## Inspiration

To onboard more developers and non-developers to the Web3 ecosystem, we need to provide more tools for rapid development.

Currently most smart contract tools are based on template which do not provide the ability to fully deploy complex and non generic contracts. We would like to see a change that's why we developed Contract Buidlr to make it easy for anyone to build and deploy a full smart contracts.

## Project Description

Contract Buidlr, allows people with or without experience to build and deploy smart contracts, by simply dragging components to the canvas and deploying when done. It's as simple as that!

## Notice

This project is still heavily under development and should not be used in production.

## Built with:

* Python
* Angular
* Hardhat

## Future developments

* In app tutorials
* Improve the handling of control statements.
* Overhaul the UI/UX
* Improve the backend code 
* Launch version 1 to the public.

## Challenges faced

Mainly, creating a lexer for parsing components.

## Running the project

* Clone the repo

Running the deployer server:

* cd into Contract Builder Deployer
* run npm install
* Create a .env file to store MNEMONIC
* Run the app.py from your terminal.

Running the frontend:

* Open another terminal/console
* cd into Contract Builder App
* run npm install
* Run the project with ng serve --open
